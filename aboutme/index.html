<h2>Julio Aleman</h2>
<h2>Never had a nickname, but some of my friends call me: "Zidane"</h2>
<p>Hello everybody, the degree I’m trying to get is applied technology, I had previous studies in programing but web design is something new for me because in the past I wasn’t to interested on it but like everything I changed.</p>
<p>My favorites sports are Judo and boxing, I practiced both when I was younger, my favorite hobby is learning new things (it can be anything)</p> 
<p>Last year I enrolled in Pathway as part of my cognitive therapy that I need due a car accident I had 2 years ago and now I’m starting a degree in BYU!!!, is amazing for me because I thought that it might not be possible for me because all of my health problems but here I am, thanks to the LORD and my Wife that supports me.</p>
